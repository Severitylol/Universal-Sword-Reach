# Universal Swordreach For Roblox
🚨 This script is compatible with only the **Roblox Classic Sword.** 🚨
1. Copy and paste the loadstring into your executor
2. Then execute and dominate sword fighting games!

# ⚙️ Settings
You can adjust the reach of the sword by changing the number from 30 to whatever you want. I made it 30 because it is less detectable, but you can customize it to your satisfaction! :)

# Loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Severitylol/Universal-Sword-Reach/main/swordreach.lua')()
```
